            <p>
              The Kratt brothers are animal lovers and Martin is a zoologist, while Chris is a biologist. They have done multiple childrens shows encouraging kids to be safe around animals but to love them as well. One such show is called the wild Kratts. An animated show where the brothers meet animals and learn about their cool features then use power suits to use those cool powers to save the animals. They are animal Lovers like me, and they have been my heros and role models for years, because they show us that all animals even the dangerous ones deserve to be saved and protected.
